#,Input Name,Input Description
"| 1
| ","| data
| ","| **type:** DataFrame or string
| **default:** -
| **details:** a data frame or address of a data frame containing
| preprocessed data. This data frame must have a column name format
| conforming to fig 1."
"| 2
| ","| splitting_type
| ","| **type:** {'instance', 'fold'}
| **default:** 'instance'
| **details:** type of splitting
| if 'instance', the splitting is performed based on
| *instace_testing_size*, *instance_validation_size*, and
| *instance_random_partitioning*
| if 'fold', the splitting is performed based on *fold_total_number* and
| fold_number"
"| 3
| ","| instance_testing_size
| ","| **type:** int or float or None
| **default:** None
| **details:**  The number of temporal units to be considered as testing
| set
| If int, is considered as the number of temporal units to be included
| in the testing set
| If float, is considered as the proportion of temporal units in the
| dataset to be included in the testing split, thus should be between
| 0.0 and 1.0.
| this input is considered if the *splitting_type* input is 'instance'
| 
| **example:** 300 or 0.6"
"| 4
| ","| instance_validation\
| _size
| ","| **type:** int or float or None
| **default:** None
| **details:** The number of temporal units to be considered as a
| validation set. 
| If int, is considered as the number of temporal units to be included
| in the validation set.
| If float, is considered as the proportion of temporal units in the
| dataset to be included in the validation split, thus should be between
| 0.0 and 1.0.
| This input is considered if the *splitting_type* input is 'instance'.
| 
| Note that if the *instance_testing_size* have value, and
| *instance_validation_size* is of type float, it is considered as the
| proportion of the temporal units in the remaining data after removing
| the testing set. Otherwise the proportion of the whole dataset is
| considered.
| **example:** 200 or 0.4"
"| 5
| ","| instance_random\
| _partitioning
| ","| **type:** bool
| **default:** False
| **details:** type of partitioning the validation data 
| If False, the validation part will be selected from the last temporal
| units in the data, otherwise the temporal units of validation part are
| selected randomly from the recorded temporal units in the data.
| 
| this input is considered if the *splitting_type* input is 'instance'"
"| 6
| ","| fold_total_number
| ","| **type:** int or None
| **default:** None
| **details:** total number of folds
| If int, is considered as the total number of folds in the cross
| validation method of partitioning
| this input is considered if the *splitting_type* input is 'fold'"
"| 7
| ","| fold_number
| ","| **type:** int or None
| **default:** None
| **details:** the fold number which validation data will be selected
| from
| this input is considered if the *splitting_type* input is 'fold'"
"| 8
| ","| forecast_horizon
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** 1
| **details:** forecast horizon to gap consideration in data splitting
| process
| By the gap, we mean the number of temporal units which are excluded
| from data to simulate the situation of real prediction in which we do
| not have access to the information of the forecast horizon - 1 units
| before the time point of the target variable."
"| 9
| ","| granularity
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** 1
| **details:** If the augmentation is applied in the transformation of
| temporal scale in the data_preprocess function, the number of smaller
| scale units in a bigger scale unit (granularity) is needed for
| detecting the sequence of the temporal units in the input data. If
| augmentation is not applied, the granularity must be set to one."
"| 10
| ","| verbose
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** 0
| **details:** The level of details in produced logging information
| available options:
| 0: no logging
| 1: only important information logging
