| temporal or spatial covariates and the id of spatial (and temporal)
| units.
| 
| Spatial ids:
| The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input data must be
| included in the *data* with the name 'spatial id level 1'.
| The id of units in the secondary spatial scales of input data could be
| included in the *data* in columns named 'spatial id level x', where x
| shows the related scale level or could be given in a
| *spatial_scale_table*.
| 
| Temporal ids (only for temporal *data_type*):
| The id of temporal units recorded in the input data for each temporal
| scale must be included as a separate column in the *data* with a name
| in a format 'temporal id level x', where 'x' is the related temporal
| scale level beginning with level 1 for the smallest scale.
| The temporal units could have a free but sortable format like year
| number, week number and so on. The combination of these temporal scale
| levels' ids should form a unique identifier.
| However, the integrated format of date and time is also supported. In
| the case of using integrated format, only the smallest temporal scale
| must be included in the *data* with the column name of 'temporal id'.
| The expected format of each scale is shown in :numref:`target tab 1`.
| 
| All the remaining columns are considered as covariates."

| including the id of bigger scale units for each unit of the smallest

| which in this case, a dictionary must be passed with the covariate

| specify the content of each column.

| The values of 'temporal id level x' and 'spatial id level x' must be

| of the corresponding column must be specified with the key 'temporal
| id'.
