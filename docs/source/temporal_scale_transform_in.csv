| **details:** 
| a data frame or address of a data frame containing temporal
| covariates. The *data* includes the following columns:
| 
| Spatial ids:
| The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input data must be
| included in the *data* with the name 'spatial id level 1'.
| The id of units in the secondary spatial scales of input data could be
| included in the *data* in columns named 'spatial id level x', where x
| shows the related scale level.
| 
| Temporal ids:
| The id of temporal units recorded in the input data for each temporal
| scale must be included as a separate column in the *data* with a name
| in a format 'temporal id level x', where 'x' is the related temporal
| scale level beginning with level 1 for the smallest scale.
| The temporal units could have a free but sortable format like year
| number, week number and so on.
| However, the integrated format of date and time is also supported. In
| the case of using integrated format, only the smallest temporal scale
| must be included in the *data* with the column name of 'temporal id'.
| The expected format of each scale is shown in :numref:`target tab 1`.
| 
| All the remaining columns are considered as covariates.

| The values of 'temporal id level x' and 'spatial id level x' must be
| the name of the column containing the temporal or spatial ids in the
| scale level x respectively.
| If the input *data* has integrated format for temporal ids, the name
| of the corresponding column must be specified with the key 'temporal
| id'.
