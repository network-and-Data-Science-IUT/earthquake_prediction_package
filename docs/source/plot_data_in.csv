| **details:** a data frame containing temporal (and spatial) covariates
| or its address.
| 
| The data must includes following columns:
| 
| Spatial ids: The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input
| data must be included in the *data* in a column with the name 'spatial
| id level 1'.
| The id of units in the secondary spatial scales of input data could be
| included in the *data* in columns named 'spatial id level x', where x
| shows the related scale level or could be given in a
| *spatial_scale_table*. Note that spatial id(s) must have unique
| values.
| 
| Temporal ids: The id of time units recorded in the input data for each
| temporal scale must be included as a separate column in the *data*
| with a name in a format 'temporal id level x', where 'x' is the
| related temporal scale level beginning with level 1 for the smallest
| scale. The temporal units could have a free but sortable format like
| year number, week number and so on. The combination of these
| temporal scale levels' ids should form a unique identifier. However the
| integrated format of date and time is also supported. In the case of
| using integrated format, only the smallest temporal scale must be
| included in the *data* with the column name of 'temporal id'. The
| expected format of each scale is shown in :numref:`target tab 1`.
