| **details:** a data frame or data address of all the covariates and
| the target variable. The data on temporal (time dependent) covariates
| and spatial (time independent) covariates could also be passed to the
| function separately. In this case, the data frame or address of data
| on temporal covariates and target variable must be included in the
| dictionary with the 'temporal_data' key, and the data frame or address
| of data on spatial covariates must be the value of key
| 'spatial_data'.
| 
| The temporal_data must include the following columns:
| 
| Spatial ids: The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input
| data must be included in the temporal_data in a column with the name
| 'spatial id level 1'.
| 
| Temporal ids: The id of time units recorded in the input data for each
| temporal scale must be included as a separate column in the
| temporal_data with a name in a format 'temporal id level x', where 'x'
| is the related temporal scale level beginning with level 1 for the
| smallest scale. The temporal units could have a free but sortable
| format like year number, week number and so on. The combination of
| these temporal scale levels' ids should form a unique identifier.
| However, the integrated format of date and time is also supported. In
| the case of using integrated format, only the smallest temporal scale
| must be included in the temporal_data with the column name of
| 'temporal id'. The expected format of each scale is shown in
| :numref:`target tab 1`.
| 
| Temporal covariates: The temporal covariates must be specified in a
| temporal_data with the column name in a format 'temporal covariate x'
| where 'x' is the covariate number.
| 
| Target: The column of the target variable in the temporal_data must be
| named 'target'.
| 
| The spatial_data must include the following columns:
| 
| Spatial ids: The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input
| data must be included in the spatial_data with the name 'spatial id
| level 1'.
| 
| Spatial covariates : The spatial covariates must be specified in a
| spatial_data with the column names in a format 'spatial covariate x',
| where the 'x' is the covariate number.

| 'spatial_data' : './Covid 19 spatial data.csv'}"

| The values of 'temporal id level x' and 'spatial id level x' must be
