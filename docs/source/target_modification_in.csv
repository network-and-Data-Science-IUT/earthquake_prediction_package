| ","| **type:** data frame or str
| default:-
| **details:** The data frame or address of data frame containing target
| variable values for different spatial and temporal units. The *data*
| includes the following columns:
| 
| Spatial id:
| The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input data must be
| included in the *data* with the name 'spatial id level 1'.
| 
| Temporal ids:
| The id of temporal units recorded in the input data for each temporal
| scale must be included as a separate column in the *data* with a name
| in a format 'temporal id level x', where 'x' is the related temporal
| scale level beginning with level 1 for the smallest scale.
| The temporal units could have a free but sortable format like year
| number, week number and so on.
| However, the integrated format of date and time is also supported. In
| the case of using integrated format, only the smallest temporal scale
| must be included in the *data* with the column name of 'temporal id'.
| The expected format of each scale is shown in:numref:`target tab 1`.
| Note. When using the integrated format, for the week scale the date of
| the week's first day must be specified as a temporal id.
| 
| Target:
| The values of the target variable must be included in a column named
| 'target'  in the *data*.
| 
| Note. extra columns are allowed.
| 
| **example:** './USA COVID-19 temporal data.csv'"

| **default:** 'normal'
| **details:** The desired mode of target variable for modeling:
| 
| 'normal':
| No modification.
| 
| 'cumulative':
| Modify the target variable to show the cumulative value of this
| variable from the first temporal unit in the data.
| 
| 'differential':
| Modify the target variable to show the difference between the value of
| the variable in current and previous temporal unit.
| 
| 'moving average' :
| Modify the target variable values to represent the moving average of
| the variable on the next higher-level temporal scale units. More
| clearly the value of the target variable for each temporal unit is the
| average of the variable values on the previous temporal unit, with a
| bigger scale (e.g. for initial temporal scale day, the target value
| for each day is the average of variable values on the previous week of
| that day).
| The next higher-level scale is determined based on the temporal id
| levels in input *data*, and if the temporal ids have a integrated
| format, it is determined based on the scale of the input *data* and
| the following sequence of temporal scales:
| Second, Minute, Hour, Day, Week, Month, Year

| a dictionary must be passed to specify the content of each column.
| The keys must be a string in one of the formats: {'temporal
| id','temporal id level x','spatial id level x', 'target'}
| The values of 'temporal id level x' and 'spatial id level x' must be
| the name of the column containing the temporal or spatial ids in the
| scale level x respectively.
| If the input data has integrated format for temporal ids, the name of
| the corresponding column must be specified with the key 'temporal
| id'.
| The value of the 'target' is the column name of the target variable.
|
