#,Input Name,Input Description
"| 1
| ","| data
| ","| **type:** DataFrame or string
| **default:** -
| **details:** All the columns must be numeric and columns
| containing non-numeric values, will be removed.
| Imputation of ids doesn't make sense, so if temporal id or
| spatial id columns contain missing values, this function will
| return data without imputing these columns.
| It's not obliging to specify temporal id, spatial id, or target
| but if each of them were present, this function will treat
| them differently."
"| 2
| ","| column_identifier
| ","| **type:** dict
| **default:** None
| **details:** The presence of this item is not necessary
| but if the data contains columns that represent temporal id,
| spatial id, or target, due to the different approaches in imputing them,
| it's necessary to identify them in column identifier. Otherwise, this function
| will treat them as other covariates.
| Note that the priority of data column names is higher than column identifier.
| So if temporal id, spatial id, or target existed in both column names and
| column identifier, the column identifier will be ignored."
"| 3
| ","| missing_value
| ","| **type:** object
| **default:** np.nan
| **details:** this entry specifies the symbol that shows missing values
| in data. These values will be replaced with np.nan. For example,
| it may be “?” or “Null”. Make sure to specify missing values,
| otherwise, if this symbol is recognized as string, the whole column
| will be dropped from the data."
"| 4
| ","| fill_missing_target
| ","| **type:** int or float
| **default:** np.nan
| **details:** If data or column identifier contains *target*,
| all the missing values in the target column, will be replaced with
| this value."
"| 5
| ","| K
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** None
| **details:** K specifies the number of nearest neighbors
| which their value will be used in imputing the missing value.
| the default value of K, in the case of “KNN” impute_strategy, is 5
| and in other strategies it's considered as the whole data.
| KNN imputer is equal to mean strategy with desired K."
"| 6
| ","| impute_strategy
| ","| **type:** string
| **default:** ‘KNN’
| **details:** Specify the strategy to impute the missing values.
| **Options:** [‘KNN’ , ‘mean’ , ‘median’ , ‘most_frequent’ , ‘min’ , ‘max’]
| *KNN*: The idea in KNN method is to identify K samples in the dataset
| that are similar or close in the space. Then we use these K samples to estimate
| the value of the missing data points. Each sample's missing values are imputed
| using the mean value of the K-neighbors found in the dataset.
| *mean*: Use min of K neighbors or the mean value of the missing feature, to
| impute the missing values.
| *min*: Use minimum value in K neighbors or in the feature to impute
| the missing values.
| *max*: Use the maximum value in K neighbors or in the feature to impute
| the missing values."
