#,Input Name,Input Description
"| 1
| ","| data
| ","| **type:** DataFrame or string
| **default:** -
| **details:**
| DataFrame containing spatial & temporal IDs and covariates."
"| 2
| ","| layer_number
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** 0
| **details:**
| If layer_number = 0 then no covariate will be added as feature(s).
| If layer_number = k > 0 then the feature list consists
| of covariates of 1-layer, 2-layer, ..., and k-layer pixel(s).
| Finding neighbours is like “breadth first search” algorithm
| as the number of layers increases we deepen our search to deeper layers.
| Note: if the “maximum_layer_number” was more than the maximum
| it can be we consider the maximum value instead.
| if the maximum history length of each covariate is
| specified in a dictionary with the covariate names as it’s
| keys and the corresponding maximum layer number as it’s values, the
| function will produce a dataframe for each combination of covariates’
| layer numbers."
"| 3
| ","| aggregate_layers
| ","| **type:** Boolean
| **default:** True
| **details:**
| True case: We aggregate all layer levels with some formula (?)
| False case: We add all layers covariates to feature list."
"| 4
| ","| verbose
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** 0
| **details:**
| the level of produced detailed logging information.
| 0: no logging.
| 1: only important information logging.
| 2: all details logging."
