#,Input Name,Input Description
"| 1
| ","| data
| ","| **type:** DataFrame or string
| **default:** -
| **details:**
| DataFrame containing spatial & temporal IDs and covariates."
"| 2
| ","| column_identifier
| ","| **type:** DataFrame
| **default:** -
| **details:**
| Column identifier directs data roles, like temporal and spatial covariates,
| and the target variable. 
| If the column names in the dataframe are not as expected, they can be 
| explicitly specified."
"| 3
| ","| forecast_horizon
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** -
| **details:**
| Shows how far into the future shift the target variable values
| when creating historical features. It determines the time steps ahead 
| for which predictions are being prepared."
"| 4
| ","| history_length
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** 1
| **details:**
| Determines how many past time steps are considered when creating
| historical features for each covariate."
"| 5
| ","| layer_number
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** 1
| **details:**
| Specifies the depth or distance of neighboring nodes considered
| when creating spatial historical features based on spatial IDs."
"| 6
| ","| aggregate_layer
| ","| **type:** boolean
| **default:** True
| **details:**
| Controls whether the spatial historical features should be aggregated
| across different layers."
"| 7
| ","| neighboring_covariates
| ","| **type:** list 
| **default:** None
| **details:**
| Lists the covariates used for calculating spatial historical features
| based on neighboring nodes."
"| 8
| ","| neighbors_dictionary
| ","| **type:** dict 
| **default:** None
| **details:**
| Maps spatial IDs to lists of their neighboring spatial IDs, used for 
| spatial historical feature calculation."
"| 9
| ","| aggregation_mode
| ","| **type:** string
| **default:** ‘mean’
| **details:**
| Determines the method used to combine values from neighboring nodes
| when calculating spatial historical features.
| **Options:**
| The aggregation_mode can typically include the following options:
|
| ‘mean’: Calculate the average value of neighboring nodes' features.
| ‘max’: Use the maximum value among neighboring nodes' features.
| ‘min’: Use the minimum value among neighboring nodes' features.
| ‘sum’: Add up the values of neighboring nodes' features.
| ‘std’: Compute the standard deviation of neighboring nodes' features."
