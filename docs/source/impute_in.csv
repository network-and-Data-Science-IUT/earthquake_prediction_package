| **details:** Data frame of temporal covariates including missing
| values.
| The *data* must include the following columns with names in the
| specified format in the description, or if the columns have arbitrary
| names their content must be specified using the *column_identifier*
| argument.
| 
| 
| Spatial id:
| The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input data must be
| included in the *data* with the name 'spatial id level 1'. The spatial
| id must have unique values.
| 
| Temporal ids:
| The id of temporal units recorded in the input data for each temporal
| scale must be included as a separate column in the  *data* with a name
| in a format 'temporal id level x', where 'x' is the related temporal
| scale level beginning with level 1 for the smallest scale.
| The temporal units could have a free but sortable format like year
| number, week number and so on. The combination of these temporal scale
| levels' ids should form a unique identifier.
| However, the integrated format of date and time is also supported. In
| the case of using integrated format, only the smallest temporal scale
| must be included in the  *data* with the column name of 'temporal id'.
| The expected format of each scale is shown in :numref:`target tab 1`.
| 
| Temporal covariates:
| The temporal (time-dependent) covariates must be specified in a
| temporal_data with the format 'temporal covariate x' where 'x' is the
| covariate number.
| 
| Target:
| The column of the target variable in the temporal_data must be named
| 'target'."

| covariate x', 'target'), a dictionary must be passed to specify the
| content of each column.
| The keys must be a string in one of the formats: {'temporal
| id','temporal id level x','spatial id level x'}
| The values of 'temporal id level x' and 'spatial id level x' must be
| the name of the column containing the temporal or spatial ids in the
| scale level x respectively.
| If the input data has integrated format for temporal ids, the name of
| the corresponding column must be specified with the key 'temporal
| id'.
