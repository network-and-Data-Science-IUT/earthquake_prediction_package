Data preprocessing module
==========================

| The data preprocessing module includes functions that perform data preprocessing and prepare the data for modeling.
| the below functions in the module empower users to preprocess data effectively, addressing missing values, organizing spatial and temporal information, aggregating data, and preparing target variables. The Data Preprocessing module serves as a foundational step in the EarthquakeForecast package, facilitating the transformation of raw data into a structured and refined format ready for advanced modeling and analysis.
| The list of functions included in this module is as follows:

.. toctree::
   impute
   set_spatial_id
   set_temporal_id
   aggregate
   extract_feature
   modify_target
   make_historical_data
   :maxdepth: 3
