#,Input Name,Input Description
"| 1
| ","| data
| ","| **type:** DataFrame or string
| **default:** -
| **details:** A DataFrame or a string as the address of a CSV file.
| The *data* must include the following column with the names with
| the specified format in the description, or if the column have
| arbitrary names, their content must be specified using the 
| *column_identifier* arguments.
| 
| Spatial ids:The id of the units in the finest spatial scale of input 
| data must be included in the *data* in a column with the name
| ‘spatial id level 1’.
|
| Temporal ids: The id of time units recorded in the input data for each
| temporal scale must be included as a separate column in the 
| temporal_data with the name in a format ‘temporal id level x’, where ‘x’
| is the related temporal scale level beginning with level 1 for the
| smallest scale. The temporal units could have a free but sortable
| format like year number, week number and so on. The combination of
| these temporal scale levels' ids should form a unique identifier.
| However, the integrated foramt of data and time is also supported. In
| the case of using integrated format, only the smallest temporal scale
| must be included in the temporal_data with the column name of 
| ‘temporal id’. The expected format of each scale is shown in Table 2.
| **examples:** ‘USGS earthquake temporal data.csv’"
"| 2
| ","| target_mode
| ","| **type:** {‘none’, ‘cumulative’, ‘differential’, 
| ‘moving average x’, ‘classify’}
| **default:** ‘none’
| **details:** The mode of target variable, which is of great importance in 
| prediction module and may cause diffrent appearance in the model. 
| ‘none’: No modification. 
| ‘cumulative’: The target variable shows the cumulative value of all
| the targets from the first temporal unit in the data.
| ‘differential’: The target variable shows the diffrence between the
| value in current and  previous temporal unit. 
| ‘moving average x’: The target variable shows the average of
| the window of x temporal units which it is located in.
| ‘classify’: This option classifies the target into some classes.
| if the ‘target_mode’ is set to ‘classify’, ‘class_boundaries’ should
| also be set.
"
"| 3
| ","| class_boundaries
| ","| **type:** list<float>
| **default:** -
| **details:** This variable only will be consider if *target_mode*
| is ‘classify’.
| **examples:**
| 1.
| [0, 3.3, 4.5]: Means there are two classes as bellow:
| [0-3.3), [3.3-4]
"
"| 4
| ","| column_identifier
| ","| **type:** dict or None
| **default:** None
| **details:** In cases where column names differ from those 
| in data input details(link to data input description), a dictionary
| must be passed to specify the content of each column.
| **examples:**
| 1.
| {“temporal ID”: “time”,
| “spatial ID”: “city”,
| “magnitude”: “mag”}
| 2.
| {“temporal ID”: “time”,
| “spatial ID”: “city”,
| “magnitude”: “mag”,
| “latitude“: “lat“,
| “longitude“: “lon“ }
"
"| 5
| ","| verbose
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** 0
| **details:** The level of details in produced logging information
| available options:
| 0: no logging
| 1: only important information logging
| 2: all details logging"
