"| 1
| ","| data
| ","| **type:** DataFrame or string
| **default:** -
| **details:** A DataFrame or a string as the address of a CSV file.
| The *data* must include the following column with the names with
| the specified format in the description, or if the column have
| arbitrary names, their content must be specified using the 
| *column_identifier* arguments.
| 
| target: this column is the target that needs to be modified in 
| in this function.
|
| temporal ID: The id of time units recorded in the input data."
"| 2
| ","| target_mode
| ","| **type:** {‘cumulative’, ‘differential’, 
| ‘moving average x’, ‘classify’} or None
| **default:** ‘none’
| **details:** The mode of target variable, which is of great importance in 
| prediction module and may cause diffrent appearance in the model. 
| ‘cumulative’: The target variable shows the cumulative value of all
| the targets from the first temporal unit in the data.
| ‘differential’: The target variable shows the diffrence between the
| value in current and  previous temporal unit. 
| ‘moving average x’: The target variable shows the average of
| the window of x temporal units which it is located in.
| ‘classify’: This option classifies the target into some classes.
| if the ‘target_mode’ is set to ‘classify’, ‘class_boundaries’ must
| also be set.
| if target_mode is None, target will not be modified.
"
"| 3
| ","| class_boundaries
| ","| **type:** list<float>
| **default:** -
| **details:** This variable only will be consider if *target_mode*
| is ‘classify’.
| **examples:**
| 1.
| [0, 3.3, 4.5]: Means there are two classes as bellow:
| [0-3.3] = label 0, [3.3-4] = label 1
| 2.
| [0, 3.3, 4.5,7]: Means there are three classes as bellow:
| [0-3.3] = label 0, [3.3-4] = label 1, [4.5-7] = label 2

"| 4
| ","| column_identifier
| ","| **type:** dict or None
| **default:** None
| **details:** In cases where column names differ from those 
| in data input details(link to data input description), a dictionary
| must be passed to specify the content of each column.
| **examples:**
| 1.
| {“temporal ID”: “time”,
| “target“:“magnitude”}"
