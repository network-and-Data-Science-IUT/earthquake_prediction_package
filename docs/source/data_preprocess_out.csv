| ","| **type:** data frame or list of data frames
| **details:**  If the user_specified *history_length* is a single
| integer, the function returns a data frame including the historical
| values of the covariates with this *history_length* and the target
| variable values at the user-specified *forecast_horizon*, but if the
| passed *history_length* is a dictionary of covariates' max history
| lengths, the function returns a list of historical data frames ordered
| based on their max history length in {1,...,max(h)} where max(h) is
| the greatest maximum history length of covariates. Each data frame
| includes historical values of each covariate with the history length
| equal to the dataframe max history length or smaller (if the maximum
| history length of that covariate specified in *history_length* is less
| than the data frame max history length). An example of the resulting
| preprocessed data frames for an *history_length* of type dictionary
| with different max history lengths for each covariate is shown in
| :numref:`target tab 2`, and :numref:`target fig 3` shows an instance of a historical data frame."
