#,Input Name,Input Description
"| 1
| ","| data
| ","| **type:** DataFrame or string
| **default:** -
| **details:** The columns mentioned below must be present in the input data,
| or their corresponding names must be specified in the column identifier.
| 
| *“spatial ID”* : A column containing positive integer values
| ​​indicating the spatial ID corresponding to each event.
| *“temporal ID”* : A column containing positive integer values
| indicating the temporal ID corresponding to each event.
| *“target”* : A column containing target values."

"| 2
| ","| column_identifier
| ","| **type:** dict
| **default:** -
| **details:** The presence of this item is necessary to 
| specify at least one temporal covariate value.
| If the input data does not contain “target”, “spatial ID”, “temporal ID”,
| these values ​​should be specified in the *column_identifier* too.
| Presence of “spatial covariate” is arbitrary.
| If there is any other identified column, the name will be replaced.
| If any of the above-mentioned items exist in both column names of
| the input *data* and *column_identifier*, the input data has a greater priority
| and specified item in *column_identifier* will be ignored.
| 
| *“temporal covariate”* : A list containing the name of columns which
| are temporal covariates."
"| 3
| ","| aggregation_mode
| ","| **type:** dict or string
| **default:** ‘mean’
| **details:** The need for aggregation is because tow or more events may
| occure in the same timascale interval and sptial interval and could not
| be specified with identifiers.
| it's possible to choose different aggregation modes for different 
| covariates, using a dictionary in the format below or choose 
| the same method for all the covariates using a string 
| with the name of the method.
| Format of dictionary:
| { a temporal covariate (‘string’): aggregation method (‘str’)}
| Options = [‘mean’, ‘max’, ‘min’, ‘std’, ‘sum’, ‘mode’, ‘base_max’]
| ‘base_max’: This option is only available in the case of srting
| and the *“base”* input should specify the column name 
| which will be considered as base.
| If this aggregation_mode is choosen, the maximum value
| of *base* column will be selected and other columns will contain
| the values of that specific event.
| value of other covariates in the same row will be selected.
| All spatial covariates meant to be constant in each spatial ID,
| so ‘sum’, ‘std’ are not valid for spatial covariates and ‘mean’ as 
| default mode, will be applied for them.
| **examples:**
| 1. {‘target’:‘max’, ‘depth’:‘sum’, ‘magnitude’:‘mean’}
| 2. ‘max’
| 3. ‘base_max’ , base = ‘depth’"
"| 4
| ","| base
| ","| **type:** string
| **default:** None
| **details:** This input is only needed and valid in the case of
| *aggregation_mode* = “base_max” and should specify the name of the base column,
| otherwise it should be *None*."
"| 5
| ","| verbose
| ","| **type:** int
| **default:** 0
| **details:** The level of details in produced logging information
| available options:
| 0: no logging
| 1: only important information logging
| 2: all details logging"
