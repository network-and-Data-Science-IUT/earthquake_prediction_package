| Description of features:
| *total energy*: the total energy released by the earthquake events
| within a specified temporal and spatial ID. this is a temporal feature.
| *b value*: the b value in `Gutenberg richter law <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gutenberg%E2%80%93Richter_law>`_. calculaing b value:
| using maximum likelihood technique for 50 nearst events to the center of
| all earthquake events in a specific spatial ID. this is a spatial feature.
| *event frequency*: the number of events occurred within a specific 
| temporal and spatial ID. this is a temporal feature.
| *delta time x*: the mean temporal unit diffrence between earthquake
| events with magnitude threshold larger than *x* (a float number)
| within a specific spatial ID. this is a spatial feature.
