#,Input Name,Input Description
"| 1
| ","| data
| ","| **type:** DataFrame or string
| **default:** -
| **details:** a data frame or address of a data frame.
| the dataframe must contain the following columns:
| ”spatial ID“, ”temporal ID“
| If density is selected in the feature list, the dataframe 
| must also include the following columns:
| “longitude“, “latitude“
| In the case of selecting other features (except density),
| the dataframe must also include the following column:
| “magnitude“
| The column names should be specified in column_identifier 
| dictionary if they differ from those above.

"| 2
| ","| column_identifier
| ","| **type:** dict or None
| **default:** None
| **details:** In cases where column names differ from those 
| in data input details(link to data input description), a dictionary
| must be passed to specify the content of each column.
| **examples:**
| 1.
| {“temporal ID”: “time”,
| “spatial ID”: “city”,
| “magnitude”: “mag”}
| 2.
| {“temporal ID”: “time”,
| “spatial ID”: “city”,
| “magnitude”: “mag”,
| “latitude“: “lat“,
| “longitude“: “lon“ }

| ","| feature_list
| ","| **type:** list<str> or None
| **default:** None
| **options:** [“density”,”event frequency”,”time elapsed x”,
|              “mean magnitude n”, “total energy”,”rate of energy”,
|              “b value”, “eta value”,”delta magnitude”,
|              ”sigma value x”,“c value”]

| **details:** 
| Description of features:
| density: the number of earthquakes divided by the area 
| where they occurred.
| event frequency: the number of earthquake events within 
| a specified spatial and temporal ID.
| time elapsed x: the time elapsed since the previous 
| earthquake event with magnitude greater than 'x'.
| mean magnitude n: over the last 'n' events, the average of 
| magnitude is calculated.
| total energy: the total energy released by the earthquake events
| within a specified temporal and spatial ID.
| rate of energy: rate of square root of seismic energy(link)
| b value: the b value in gutenberg richter law(link to wikipedia for b value).
| eta value: summation of the mean square deviation from the regression line
| based on the Gutenberg Richter inverse power law(link).
| delta magnitude: the diffrence between the magnitude of the event
| and the expected magnitude based on gutenberg richter law(link).
| (link to wikipedia for gutenberg richter law).
| sigma value x: the average time between main events 
| (magnitude greater than x).
| c value x: standard deviation of times between
| main events(magnitude greater than x).
| time elapsed x, c value x, sigma value x, delta magnitude, b value,
| and eta value are inspired by the paper below:
